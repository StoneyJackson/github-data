# Claude Code Session: Domain Model Enrichment Planning
**Date:** September 17, 2025, 01:27  
**Topic:** Creating detailed implementation plans for domain model enrichment phases  
**Duration:** Comprehensive planning session  

## Session Overview

This session focused on creating detailed, sprint-level implementation plans for transforming the GitHub Data project from anemic domain models to rich domain entities following Clean Architecture principles. The session built upon an existing high-level plan and created 5 comprehensive phase-specific implementation guides.

## Prompts and Actions

### Initial Request
```
read @docs/reports/2025-09-17-domain-model-enrichment-plan.md . Is this detailed enough, or should each phase be broken down into a more detailed plan?
```

**Analysis Provided:** 
- Reviewed the existing high-level architectural plan
- Identified that while comprehensive for architectural approval, each phase needed detailed implementation breakdowns
- Recommended creating sprint-level plans with specific task breakdowns, dependency maps, and implementation order

### Main Request
```
Create detailed plans for each phase. Write each phase plan to a separate file in docs/reports
```

**Planning Mode:** User activated plan mode, requiring comprehensive research and planning before implementation.

### Research Phase
**Files Analyzed:**
- `src/models.py` - Current anemic domain models (124 lines)
- `src/operations/restore.py` - Procedural business logic (100+ lines examined)
- `src/operations/save.py` - Save operations structure
- `src/conflict_strategies.py` - Current conflict resolution (43 lines)
- Test file structure analysis for comprehensive test planning

#### Phase 3: Business Rule Extraction Plan
**File Created:** `docs/reports/phase-3-business-rule-extraction-plan.md`
**Scope:** 3-4 sprints (6-8 weeks)
**Key Components:**
- **File-by-file migration** from procedural to entity-based code
- **Specific refactoring targets:**
  - `src/operations/restore.py` - 15+ functions migrated to entity methods
  - `src/conflict_strategies.py` - Logic moved to domain services
  - `src/github/metadata.py` - Formatting moved to entity methods
- **Backward compatibility:** Deprecation warnings and adapter patterns
- **Migration validation:** Before/after testing ensuring identical behavior

#### Phase 4: Factory and Builder Patterns Plan
**File Created:** `docs/reports/phase-4-factory-builder-patterns-plan.md`
**Scope:** 2-3 sprints (4-6 weeks)
**Key Components:**
- **Entity factories** with comprehensive validation:
  - `IssueFactory` - 256-char title limit, 10-assignee limit, state validation
  - `LabelFactory` - Hex color validation, system label creation, auto-color generation
- **Builder patterns:**
  - `RepositoryDataBuilder` - Fluent interface with step-by-step validation
  - `IssueHierarchyBuilder` - Complex hierarchy construction with constraint checking
- **Advanced features:** Test data creation, conflict resolution, validation pipelines

#### Phase 5: Error Handling Enhancement Plan
**File Created:** `docs/reports/phase-5-error-handling-enhancement-plan.md`
**Scope:** 2 sprints (3-4 weeks)
**Key Components:**
- **Rich exception hierarchy** with contextual information:
  - `DomainErrorContext` - Correlation IDs, timestamps, operation tracking
  - `ValidationError` - Field-specific errors with suggestions
  - `StateTransitionError` - Allowed transitions and guidance
  - `HierarchyError` - Depth analysis and cycle detection
