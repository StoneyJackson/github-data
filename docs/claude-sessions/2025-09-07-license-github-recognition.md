# Session Summary: GitHub License Recognition Fix

**Date**: 2025-09-07  
**Topic**: Resolving GitHub license recognition issue

## Problem
GitHub was not recognizing the project's license despite having a REUSE-compliant `LICENSES/MIT.txt` file.

## Discussion
- User asked about GitHub not recognizing the license
- Investigated current license setup: found `LICENSES/MIT.txt` (REUSE format)
- Discussed three solutions:
  1. Create standard `LICENSE` file (copy from LICENSES/MIT.txt)
  2. Create symlink from `LICENSE` to `LICENSES/MIT.txt`
  3. Add license metadata to package.json (Node.js only)
- User asked if second solution would work for GitLab too
- Confirmed symlink approach works for both GitHub and GitLab while maintaining REUSE compliance

## Actions Taken
1. Created symlink: `LICENSE -> LICENSES/MIT.txt`
2. Verified symlink creation with `ls -la LICENSE`
3. **Fix Applied**: Symlink didn't work on GitHub (showed path instead of content)
4. Removed symlink and created standard `LICENSE` file
5. Copied content from `LICENSES/MIT.txt` to `LICENSE`

## Commands Used
```bash
find . -name "LICENSE*" -o -name "COPYING*" -o -name "license*"
ls -la LICENSES/
ls -la | grep -i license
ln -s LICENSES/MIT.txt LICENSE
ls -la LICENSE
# After discovering symlink issue:
rm LICENSE
cp LICENSES/MIT.txt LICENSE
git add LICENSE
git commit -s -m "fix: replace LICENSE symlink with standard LICENSE file"
git push
```

## Outcome
- ✅ Standard LICENSE file created successfully
- ✅ Maintains REUSE compliance (both files exist)
- ✅ GitHub now properly recognizes MIT license
- ⚠️ Two copies of license text (trade-off for GitHub compatibility)

## Key Decisions
- Initially chose symlink approach to maintain single source of truth
- **Pivot**: Switched to standard LICENSE file when symlink failed on GitHub
- Accepted duplication trade-off for universal platform compatibility
- Preserved REUSE specification compliance with parallel `LICENSES/MIT.txt`

## Lessons Learned
- GitHub web interface doesn't display symlink content, only the link path
- Standard LICENSE file in repository root is most reliable approach
- REUSE compliance can coexist with platform-specific requirements
