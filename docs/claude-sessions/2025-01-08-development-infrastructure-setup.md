- Added PDM configuration with dependencies and dev dependencies
- Updated Dockerfile to use PDM for dependency installation
- Updated Makefile commands to use PDM workflow
- Created .gitignore with PDM-specific ignore patterns
- Updated CLAUDE.md with PDM documentation and development commands

### 6. Clean Code Implementation
**Prompt:** "Before continuing, please follow the clean-code step-down-rule where functions and classes at a higher-level of abstraction come before those at a lower-level of abstraction when in the same file."

**Actions:**
- Refactored src/main.py following the step-down rule
- Reorganized functions from highest to lowest abstraction level
- Created Configuration class for structured data
- Implemented downward dependencies (higher-level functions call lower-level ones)
- Added proper type hints throughout
- Created clear separation between business logic, configuration, and infrastructure

### 7. Clean Code Standards Documentation
**Prompt:** "Please add Robert Martin's 'Clean Code' as a coding standard in CONTRIBUTING.md and in CLAUDE.md"

**Follow-up:** "I forgot that CLAUDE.md points to CONTRIBUTING.md. So we probably don't need to repeat ourselves in CONTRIBUTING.md. True?"

**Actions:**
- Added comprehensive Clean Code section to CONTRIBUTING.md with principles, examples, and guidelines
- Included Function Design, Naming Conventions, Code Organization, Error Handling, and Testing principles
- Added Python-specific guidelines and code quality tool requirements
- Provided good vs bad code examples demonstrating Clean Code principles
- Added concise Clean Code reference to CLAUDE.md pointing to CONTRIBUTING.md
- Avoided duplication by keeping detailed standards in CONTRIBUTING.md only

### 8. GitHub API Client Architecture
**Prompt:** "OK. I think we're ready to tackle the GitHub API client setup. What did you have in mind?"

**Follow-up:** "Good. Go ahead."

**Actions:**
- Proposed clean architecture with separation of concerns
- Created src/models.py with Pydantic data models (GitHubUser, Label, Comment, Issue, RepositoryData)
- Created src/github_client.py with GitHub API wrapper following step-down rule
- Implemented type-safe GitHub client with PyGithub abstraction
- Added methods for fetching labels, issues, comments, and creating repository content
- Included proper data model conversion from PyGithub objects to Pydantic models

### 9. Terminology Consistency
**Prompt:** "Please use the term 'actions' instead of 'operations'. That's what I called them (save and restore) in the README.md."

**Actions:**
- Created src/actions/ directory instead of src/operations/
- Created src/actions/save.py with save repository data functionality
- Created src/actions/restore.py with restore repository data functionality
- Implemented step-down organization in both action modules
- Ensured terminology consistency between README.md documentation and code structure

### 10. JSON Storage Implementation
**Prompt:** "Excellent. Please continue."

**Actions:**
- Created src/storage/json_storage.py with type-safe JSON operations
- Implemented save_json_data and load_json_data functions with Pydantic model support
- Added comprehensive error handling for file operations and JSON validation
- Created helper functions following step-down rule organization
- Updated src/main.py to integrate actual save/restore functionality
- Created comprehensive tests/test_json_storage.py with full test coverage
- Updated todo list to mark all infrastructure tasks as completed

### 11. Session Planning
**Prompt:** "I think this is a great start. Tomorrow, I would like to work on testing. Are you able to remind me of that when I start you tomorrow?"

**Actions:**
- Explained Claude's stateless nature and suggested reminder options
- Outlined testing priorities for next session:
  - GitHub API client methods testing
  - Save/restore actions integration tests  
  - Error handling scenarios
  - End-to-end container testing
- Provided guidance for session continuity

### 12. Session Documentation Request
**Prompt:** "Save session and commit."
**Follow-up:** "Please create a session summary before committing."
**Follow-up:** "In the session summary, please include all of my prompts and your corresponding actions. Please review other session summary files for examples."

**Actions:**
- Created docs/claude-sessions/ directory for session documentation
