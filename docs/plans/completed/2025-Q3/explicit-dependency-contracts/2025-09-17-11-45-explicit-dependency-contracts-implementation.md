# Claude Code Session: Explicit Dependency Contracts Implementation

**Date:** September 17, 2025  
**Time:** 11:45 - Current  
**Topic:** Implementation of Explicit Dependency Contracts Plan  
**Status:** Completed Successfully

## Session Overview

This session involved the complete implementation of the explicit dependency contracts plan from `/workspaces/github-data/docs/plans/2025-09-17-11-45-explicit-dependency-contracts.md`. The goal was to introduce proper dependency inversion to the GitHub Data project by creating abstract interfaces/protocols for the major dependencies.

## User Prompts and Actions

### Initial Request
```
User: Read @docs/plans/2025-09-17-11-45-explicit-dependency-contracts.md 
```

**Claude's Response:** Reviewed the comprehensive plan for introducing dependency inversion to address tight coupling between components. The plan outlined a 5-phase approach to implement explicit contracts for GitHubService, Storage Operations, Rate Limiter, and API Boundary.

### Implementation Command
```
User: Implement the plan.
```

**Claude's Response:** Initiated full implementation following the structured plan with proper task tracking.

## Implementation Process

### Phase 1: Task Planning and Setup
- Created comprehensive todo list with 11 tasks covering all implementation phases
- Organized work into logical phases following the original plan

### Phase 2: Core Service Protocols Creation
**Files Created:**
- `src/github/protocols.py` - Core GitHub service protocols
- `src/storage/protocols.py` - Storage service protocols

**Key Protocols Implemented:**
1. **RepositoryService** - Abstract interface for GitHub repository operations (25+ methods)
2. **StorageService** - Abstract interface for data persistence operations
3. **RateLimitHandler** - Abstract interface for rate limiting operations
4. **GitHubApiBoundary** - Abstract interface for GitHub API boundary operations

### Phase 3: Service Implementation Updates
**Files Modified:**
- `src/github/service.py` - Updated GitHubService to implement RepositoryService protocol
- `src/github/boundary.py` - Updated to implement GitHubApiBoundary protocol
- `src/github/rate_limiter.py` - Updated to implement RateLimitHandler protocol

### Phase 4: Storage Layer Implementation
**Files Created:**
- `src/storage/json_storage_service.py` - Concrete JSON storage implementation
- Updated `src/storage/__init__.py` - Added factory function for storage services

**Key Implementation:**
```python
def create_storage_service(storage_type: str = "json") -> StorageService:
    """Factory function for storage services."""
    if storage_type == "json":
        return JsonStorageService()
    raise ValueError(f"Unknown storage type: {storage_type}")
```

### Phase 5: Operations Layer Refactoring
**Files Modified:**
- `src/operations/save.py` - Refactored to use dependency injection
- `src/operations/restore.py` - Refactored to use dependency injection

**Key Changes:**
- Added new functions with dependency injection: `save_repository_data_with_services()`, `restore_repository_data_with_services()`
- Maintained backward compatibility with legacy wrapper functions
- Updated all internal functions to accept and use injected services

### Phase 6: Main Entry Point Updates
**Files Modified:**
- `src/main.py` - Updated to use dependency injection approach

**Implementation:**
```python
def _perform_save_operation(config: "Configuration") -> None:
    github_service = create_github_service(config.github_token)
    storage_service = create_storage_service("json")
    
    save_repository_data_with_services(
        github_service, storage_service, config.github_repo, config.data_path
    )
```

### Phase 7: Testing Infrastructure
**Files Created:**
- `tests/mocks/__init__.py` - Mock services package
- `tests/mocks/mock_github_service.py` - MockGitHubService implementation
- `tests/mocks/mock_storage_service.py` - MockStorageService implementation
- `tests/test_dependency_injection.py` - Comprehensive dependency injection tests

**Mock Services Features:**
- Full protocol compliance with RepositoryService and StorageService
- Call tracking for test verification
- In-memory storage for fast testing
- Comprehensive test coverage of all operations

### Phase 8: Quality Assurance and Verification
**Actions Performed:**
- Fixed all linting and formatting issues
- Resolved type checking errors
- Ensured all existing tests continue to pass
- Verified new dependency injection tests pass completely

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Protocol-Based Design
Used Python's ABC (Abstract Base Classes) with `@abstractmethod` decorators to define explicit contracts:

```python
class RepositoryService(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def get_repository_labels(self, repo_name: str) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
        """Get all labels from repository."""
        pass
```

### 2. Backward Compatibility Strategy
Maintained all existing function signatures as legacy wrappers:

```python
def save_repository_data(github_token: str, repo_name: str, data_path: str) -> None:
    """Legacy function - deprecated, use save_repository_data_with_services 
    for dependency injection."""
    github_service = create_github_service(github_token)
    storage_service = create_storage_service("json")
    save_repository_data_with_services(github_service, storage_service, repo_name, data_path)
```

### 3. Factory Pattern Implementation
Created factory functions for service instantiation:

```python
def create_storage_service(storage_type: str = "json") -> StorageService:
    """Factory function for storage services."""
    if storage_type == "json":
        return JsonStorageService()
    raise ValueError(f"Unknown storage type: {storage_type}")
```

### 4. Comprehensive Mock Services
Implemented full-featured mock services for testing:

```python
class MockGitHubService(RepositoryService):
    def __init__(self, mock_data: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None):
        self.mock_data = mock_data or {}
        self.created_labels = []  # Track creation calls
        self.deleted_labels = []  # Track deletion calls
        # ... comprehensive tracking
```
