## Risk Mitigation

### High-Priority Risks

#### Test Infrastructure Complexity
- **Risk:** Complex milestone relationships may create unstable tests
- **Mitigation:** Use simplified test data and isolated test scenarios
- **Contingency:** Create minimal working examples before complex scenarios

#### Container Test Performance
- **Risk:** Container tests may become too slow for development workflow
- **Mitigation:** Optimize test data size and use focused test scenarios
- **Contingency:** Mark slow tests appropriately for selective execution

#### Integration Test Dependencies
- **Risk:** External GitHub API dependencies may cause test flakiness
- **Mitigation:** Use comprehensive mocking and fixture-based testing
- **Contingency:** Implement retry logic and fallback test scenarios

### Medium-Priority Risks

#### Test Data Management
- **Risk:** Complex milestone test data may be difficult to maintain
- **Mitigation:** Use data builder patterns and shared fixtures
- **Contingency:** Simplify test scenarios if maintenance becomes burdensome

#### Coverage Targets
- **Risk:** Achieving high test coverage may require excessive test code
- **Mitigation:** Focus on critical paths and high-value test scenarios
- **Contingency:** Adjust coverage targets based on practical implementation
