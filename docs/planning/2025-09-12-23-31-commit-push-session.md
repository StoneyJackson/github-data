**Topic:** Git commit and push operations  
**Claude Model:** Sonnet 4 (claude-sonnet-4-20250514)

## Session Overview

This session involved creating a comprehensive commit for pending changes and pushing to the remote repository. The work included GitHub API enhancements, manual testing framework, and development environment improvements.

## User Prompts and Actions

### 1. Initial Commit Request

**User Prompt:** `commit`

**Claude Actions:**
- Executed parallel git status, staged diff, unstaged diff, and log commands to assess repository state
- Found multiple modified files (.devcontainer/devcontainer.json, .gitignore, README.md, src/github/graphql_converters.py, src/github/graphql_queries.py, src/models.py) and untracked files (.env.template, docs/manual-testing.md, manual-test-repos.yml, scripts/manual-testing/)
- Added all relevant files to staging area
- Created comprehensive commit with conventional commit message following project standards
- Included DCO sign-off as required by project guidelines

**Commit Details:**
- **Hash:** 04dc4bd
- **Message:** "feat: enhance GitHub API with comprehensive data modeling and manual testing"
- **Files Changed:** 12 files, 519 insertions, 19 deletions
- **Key Changes:**
  - Added comprehensive ID support for GraphQL/REST consistency
  - Enhanced user data with avatar_url and html_url fields
  - Improved comment ordering using UPDATED_AT
  - Added makefile-tools VS Code extension
  - Created manual testing framework
  - Updated README with clearer GitHub token requirements
  - Added .env.template for development setup

### 2. Push to Remote

**User Prompt:** `push`

**Claude Actions:**
- Executed `git push` command
- Successfully pushed commit 04dc4bd to origin/main

### 3. Session Summary Request

**User Prompt:** `save session with all prompts`

**Claude Actions:**
- Initially attempted to create session summary with incorrect timestamp
- Corrected timestamp after user feedback to use current date/time (2025-09-12-23-31)
- Created this comprehensive session summary documenting all prompts and resulting actions

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Commit Strategy:** Included all related changes in a single comprehensive commit rather than breaking into smaller commits, as the changes formed a cohesive feature enhancement
2. **Commit Message:** Used conventional commit format with "feat:" prefix to indicate new functionality
3. **File Organization:** Added all new testing infrastructure and templates to maintain project completeness

## Commands Executed

```bash
# Assessment phase
git status
git diff --staged

git commit -s -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
feat: enhance GitHub API with comprehensive data modeling and manual testing
