# Product Requirements Document: Pull Request Reviews and Review Comments Feature

**Date:** 2025-10-12  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Draft  

## Executive Summary

This PRD defines the requirements for implementing save and restore functionality for GitHub pull request reviews and their associated review comments. This feature extends the existing GitHub Data project's capabilities to include comprehensive pull request workflow data preservation.

## Background

The GitHub Data project currently supports saving and restoring:
- Repository labels
- Issues and sub-issues with hierarchical relationships
- Issue comments
- Pull requests
- Pull request comments (general discussion comments)

**Gap:** Pull request reviews and review comments (code-specific feedback) are not currently supported, limiting the completeness of pull request workflow preservation.

**Consistency Requirement:** Pull request reviews and their comments must follow the same hierarchical patterns and handling mechanisms established for issues and their comments, and pull requests and their comments. This ensures architectural consistency and leverages existing proven patterns.

## Problem Statement

### Current Limitations
1. **Incomplete PR Workflow Coverage**: Pull request reviews contain critical code review feedback that is lost during repository migrations
2. **Missing Code Review Context**: Review comments tied to specific code lines provide essential development context
3. **Workflow Disruption**: Development teams lose valuable code review history during repository transitions

### Business Impact
- **Development Teams**: Lose code review history and learning opportunities
- **Repository Migrations**: Incomplete data preservation affects team productivity
- **Compliance/Audit**: Missing review trails for regulated environments

## Goals and Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Complete PR Workflow Coverage**: Save and restore all pull request review data
2. **Code Review Preservation**: Maintain review comments with their code context
3. **Architectural Consistency**: Follow existing parent-child relationship patterns established for issues→comments and pull requests→comments
4. **Strategy Pattern Alignment**: Implement using the same strategy patterns and dependency management as existing entity relationships

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Save all PR reviews with metadata (state, body, submitted_at)
- ✅ Save review comments with code line associations
- ✅ Restore reviews maintaining GitHub relationships
- ✅ Restore review comments with proper PR and review linkage
- ✅ Handle review states (PENDING, APPROVED, CHANGES_REQUESTED, DISMISSED)
- ✅ Preserve reviewer information and timestamps

  - Cascade from review inclusion settings using existing parent-child enforcement mechanisms
  - Parent-child dependency enforcement identical to issue→comment and PR→comment relationships

## Technical Requirements

### TR-1: GitHub API Integration
- **GraphQL Queries**: Extend pull request queries to include reviews and review comments
- **REST API Fallback**: Support REST endpoints for review-specific operations
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement appropriate rate limiting for review data

### TR-2: Data Model Extensions
```json
{
  "pr_reviews": [
    {
      "id": "string",
      "pr_number": "integer",
      "user": "object",
      "body": "string",
      "state": "string",
      "html_url": "string",
      "pull_request_url": "string",
      "author_association": "string",
      "submitted_at": "string",
      "commit_id": "string",
      "_original_id": "string",
      "_original_reviewer": "string",
      "_original_submitted_at": "string"
    }
  ],
  "pr_review_comments": [
    {
      "id": "string",
      "review_id": "string",
      "pr_number": "integer",
      "diff_hunk": "string",
      "path": "string",
      "line": "integer",
      "body": "string",
      "user": "object",
      "created_at": "string",
      "updated_at": "string",
      "html_url": "string",
      "pull_request_url": "string",
      "in_reply_to_id": "string",
      "_original_id": "string",
      "_original_author": "string",
      "_original_created_at": "string",
      "_original_path": "string",
      "_original_line": "integer"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note**: During restore operations, original metadata (_original_*) is appended to the body content in a consistent format matching existing issue and pull request comment patterns.

### TR-3: Strategy Pattern Implementation
- **Save Strategy**: `PullRequestReviewsSaveStrategy`
- **Save Strategy**: `PullRequestReviewCommentsSaveStrategy`
- **Restore Strategy**: `PullRequestReviewsRestoreStrategy`
- **Restore Strategy**: `PullRequestReviewCommentsRestoreStrategy`

**Architectural Consistency Requirements**:
- **Pattern Mirroring**: Reviews→review comments must mirror issues→issue comments and PRs→PR comments exactly
- **Strategy Reuse**: Leverage existing strategy patterns, mixins, and dependency resolution frameworks
- **Metadata Consistency**: Follow identical metadata integration patterns from issue and pull request comment strategies
- **Configuration Alignment**: Use the same boolean environment variable patterns and cascading logic
- **Dependency Management**: Apply identical parent-child relationship enforcement and selective filtering mechanisms
- **Template Method Alignment**: Integrate with existing template method patterns in save/restore strategies

### TR-4: Dependency Management
- **Reviews depend on**: Pull requests (mirrors issues dependency pattern)
- **Review comments depend on**: Pull request reviews (mirrors issue comments→issues and PR comments→PRs patterns)
- **Cascading deletion**: When PRs are excluded, exclude related reviews/comments (identical to existing cascading logic)
- **Selective Filtering**: Apply the same SelectiveFilteringMixin and EntityCouplingMixin patterns used for issues/comments and PRs/comments
- **Dependency Resolution**: Use existing DependencyResolver framework with identical topological sorting
