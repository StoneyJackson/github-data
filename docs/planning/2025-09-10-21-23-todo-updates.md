# Claude Session: TODO.md Updates

**Date**: 2025-09-10 21:23  
**Session Type**: Documentation Updates  
**Files Modified**: TODO.md

## Session Summary

Updated the GitHub Data project TODO.md file with new feature requirements and improved organization.

## Prompts and Actions

### 1. Review TODO.md
**User Prompt**: "Let's review the TODO.md"

**Action**: Read and analyzed the complete TODO.md file to understand current project status and priorities.

**Key Findings**:
- Testing implementation is complete with comprehensive coverage
- Core development tasks mostly complete with several major features implemented
- Immediate priorities focus on robustness and user experience features
- Project is in mature development state with strong testing foundation

### 2. Add User Notification Prevention Feature
**User Prompt**: "Let's add a couple of issues to the TODO.md. First, when text in the body of an issue or a comment names a user with the form '@username', that user will receive a notification. When a user restores data to a repository, they may not want that to happen. We should give the user the option of preventing notifications to named users. We can prevent it by substituting `@username` with [AT]username. Please add that to TODO.md. Feel free to reword it so its shorter."

**Action**: Added new todo item under Core Development Tasks:
- Line 52: "Add option to prevent user notifications by replacing @username with [AT]username in restored content"

### 3. Add Issue Linking Management Features
**User Prompt**: "Next, GitHub allows comments and issues to link to other issues in the body of their text either by a direct URL, or through various shortcut syntax (see: <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/autolinked-references-and-urls>). There are two problems here. 1) If the link is internal (it points to an issue in the same repo), there is a chance that the issue number changes when we restore issues, so we need to update these links to point to the corresponding new restored issue. 2) If the link points to an issue outside the original repository, then we should give the user the option to break those links because those links will add a return link to the issue in the repository, and the user may not want that. See if you can simplify these ideas and add them to TODO.md."

**Action**: Added two new todo items under Core Development Tasks:
- Line 53: "Update internal issue links to use new issue numbers after restore (handle URL and shortcut syntax)"
- Line 54: "Add option to break external issue links to prevent unwanted backlinks to restored repository"

### 4. Reorganize Completed Sections
**User Prompt**: "In TODO.md, move the completed 'Testing Implementation' section to the bottom, just before 'Notes'"

**Action**: Reorganized TODO.md structure using MultiEdit:
- Removed completed "Testing Implementation" section from top priority area
- Moved it to bottom of file before "Notes" section
- Improved document flow to show active priorities first

### 5. Save Session
**User Prompt**: "Save session with all prompts."

**Action**: Created session documentation with corrected timestamp (2025-09-10-21-23)

## Key Decisions

1. **Feature Prioritization**: Added user experience features that address real-world concerns:
   - Preventing unwanted notifications during restore
   - Managing issue link integrity and external dependencies

2. **Documentation Organization**: Moved completed work to bottom to improve readability and focus on active development priorities

3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Ensured new features cover both technical requirements (link updates) and user control options (notification and backlink prevention)

## Outcomes

- TODO.md now includes 3 new high-priority features addressing restore operation concerns
- Document structure improved with completed work moved to reference section
- Better alignment with user needs for GitHub repository migration scenarios

## Follow-up Items

- These new features should be implemented in priority order after current core development tasks
- Consider grouping related restore configuration options into a unified settings system
- Document these features in user guide when implemented

## Technical Notes

- User notification prevention: Simple text replacement approach (@username â†’ [AT]username)
- Issue link management: Requires parsing GitHub's autolink syntax and URL patterns
- External link control: Optional feature to prevent unwanted repository connections

## Files Modified

- `/workspaces/github-data/TODO.md`: Added 3 new todo items and reorganized completed sections
