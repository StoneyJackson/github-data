- **Comments**: Preserve comment threads and metadata
- **Pull Requests**: Backup PRs with branch dependency validation
- **Metadata**: Maintain data integrity and relationships

### Restore Operations
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle existing data conflicts during restoration
- **Two-Phase Restore**: Implement hierarchical sub-issue restoration
- **Data Validation**: Ensure restored data maintains integrity
- **Dependency Management**: Handle cross-references and relationships

### Workflow Management
- **CLI Operations**: Design and implement user-friendly command interfaces
- **Progress Tracking**: Provide clear feedback during long operations
- **Error Recovery**: Implement robust error handling and recovery
- **Configuration**: Support multiple repository configurations

## Data Handling Expertise

### JSON Data Structures
- Design efficient data schemas for backup files
- Implement data validation and schema versioning
- Handle large datasets with memory efficiency
- Support incremental and selective operations

### Hierarchical Relationships
- **Sub-Issues**: Implement parent-child issue relationships
- **Comment Threads**: Preserve comment hierarchies and replies
