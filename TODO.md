## Immediate Development Priorities

### Testing Implementation (Next Session Priority)
- [x] Implement GitHub API client method tests with PyGithub mocking
- [ ] Create save/restore integration tests for end-to-end workflow validation
- [ ] Add error scenario testing (network failures, API rate limits, invalid data)
- [ ] Implement container integration testing for full Docker workflow

### Core Development Tasks
- [x] Complete GitHub API client implementation for labels, issues, and comments
- [ ] Implement issue subissue relationship handling
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling for GitHub API rate limits
- [ ] Implement data validation and sanitization for restore operations
- [ ] Add progress reporting for backup/restore operations

## Configuration & Documentation
- [ ] Create configuration documentation for GitHub token setup
- [ ] Document backup/restore file format specifications
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide for common issues
- [ ] Create user guide with example workflows

## Quality Assurance & Compliance
- [ ] Run full test suite validation
- [ ] Verify REUSE license compliance
- [ ] Complete Clean Code standards audit
- [ ] Test DCO sign-off requirements in practice

## Infrastructure & Tooling
- [ ] Set up automated DCO enforcement (GitHub App installation)
- [ ] Configure branch protection rules requiring DCO checks
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
- [ ] Create and push container images in CI/CD
- [ ] Automate release process in CI/CD
- [ ] Implement commit message linting (commitlint) for Conventional Commits

## Platform Integration
- [ ] Test GitHub license recognition (currently working with LICENSE file)
- [ ] Validate PR template functionality on GitHub
- [ ] Test GitLab MR template functionality
- [ ] Verify cross-platform compatibility

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Consider automated versioning based on conventional commits
- [ ] Evaluate need for multiple GitLab MR templates
- [ ] Plan team onboarding documentation
- [ ] Design template iteration process based on user feedback

## Session Documentation
- [ ] Maintain session summary workflow for all future Claude interactions
- [ ] Document development decisions and rationale
- [ ] Keep searchable history of Claude Code interactions

## Completed Infrastructure âœ…
- [x] Project renamed from "DinD Claude Code Template" to "GitHub Data"
- [x] Python development infrastructure with PDM package management
- [x] Clean Code architecture with step-down rule organization
- [x] Conventional Commits implementation with comprehensive guidelines
- [x] DCO (Developer Certificate of Origin) requirements documentation
- [x] REUSE-compliant MIT licensing with GitHub recognition fix
- [x] GitHub and GitLab PR/MR templates
- [x] Type-safe GitHub API client foundation with Pydantic models
- [x] Docker containerization with development environment
- [x] Development tooling (pytest, black, flake8, mypy, make commands)
- [x] Session documentation workflow established

## Notes
- Development environment ready with DevContainer
- All commits must use `git commit -s` for DCO compliance
- Follow Conventional Commits specification for all commit messages
- Next major milestone: Complete testing implementation and validation
- Project scope: GitHub repository labels, issues, subissues, and comments only
