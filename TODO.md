# GitHub Data Project TODO

*Generated from Claude session summaries on 2025-09-08, updated 2025-09-09*

## Immediate Development Priorities

### Testing Implementation (Mostly Complete)
- [x] Implement GitHub API client method tests with PyGithub mocking
- [x] Create save/restore integration tests for end-to-end workflow validation
- [x] Add error scenario testing (network failures, API rate limits, invalid data)
- [ ] Implement container integration testing for full Docker workflow

### Core Development Tasks (Next Priority)
- [x] Complete GitHub API client implementation for labels, issues, and comments
- [ ] Implement issue subissue relationship handling
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling for GitHub API rate limits
- [ ] Implement data validation and sanitization for restore operations
- [ ] Add progress reporting for backup/restore operations

## Configuration & Documentation
- [ ] Create configuration documentation for GitHub token setup
- [ ] Document backup/restore file format specifications
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide for common issues
- [ ] Create user guide with example workflows

## Quality Assurance & Compliance
- [x] Run full test suite validation
- [x] Verify REUSE license compliance
- [x] Complete Clean Code standards audit
- [ ] Test DCO sign-off requirements in practice

### Clean Code Improvements (From Audit)
- [ ] **HIGH PRIORITY**: Fix Step-Down Rule violations in main.py:14-27, boundary.py:42-46, save.py:25-39
- [ ] **MEDIUM PRIORITY**: Standardize error handling patterns across codebase (restore.py:77-78, boundary.py:107)
- [ ] **LOW PRIORITY**: Eliminate DRY violations for error messages (main.py:86,95) and file operations
- [ ] **ENHANCEMENT**: Improve docstring completeness with parameter/return documentation and usage examples

## Infrastructure & Tooling
- [ ] Set up automated DCO enforcement (GitHub App installation)
- [ ] Configure branch protection rules requiring DCO checks
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
- [ ] Create and push container images in CI/CD
- [ ] Automate release process in CI/CD
- [ ] Implement commit message linting (commitlint) for Conventional Commits

## Platform Integration
- [ ] Test GitHub license recognition (currently working with LICENSE file)
- [ ] Validate PR template functionality on GitHub
- [ ] Test GitLab MR template functionality
- [ ] Verify cross-platform compatibility

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Consider automated versioning based on conventional commits
- [ ] Evaluate need for multiple GitLab MR templates
- [ ] Plan team onboarding documentation
- [ ] Design template iteration process based on user feedback

## Session Documentation
- [ ] Maintain session summary workflow for all future Claude interactions
- [ ] Document development decisions and rationale
- [ ] Keep searchable history of Claude Code interactions

## Completed Infrastructure âœ…
- [x] Project renamed from "DinD Claude Code Template" to "GitHub Data"
- [x] Python development infrastructure with PDM package management
- [x] Clean Code architecture with step-down rule organization
- [x] Conventional Commits implementation with comprehensive guidelines
- [x] DCO (Developer Certificate of Origin) requirements documentation
- [x] REUSE-compliant MIT licensing with GitHub recognition fix
- [x] GitHub and GitLab PR/MR templates
- [x] Type-safe GitHub API client foundation with Pydantic models
- [x] Docker containerization with development environment
- [x] Development tooling (pytest, black, flake8, mypy, make commands)
- [x] Session documentation workflow established
- [x] Comprehensive integration test suite for save/restore workflows
- [x] Error handling tests for API failures and malformed data
- [x] Code style compliance (line length, formatting standards)
- [x] REUSE license compliance verification (all 48 files compliant)

## Notes
- Development environment ready with DevContainer
- All commits must use `git commit -s` for DCO compliance
- Follow Conventional Commits specification for all commit messages
- Next major milestone: Core development tasks and container integration testing
- Project scope: GitHub repository labels, issues, subissues, and comments only
